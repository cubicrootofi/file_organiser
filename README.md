- This app allows the user to specify a folder/directory in which the user wants to organize the files within.
- The user can also specify if they want the files to be filtered according to their size.
- The user can choose whether or not the original files will be deleted after copying and sorting.
- Dry run allows the user to see the message box with the files and details without actually copying or moving anything (it's just a simulator).
- After selecting the folder/directory, the app will automatically create folders with the name of the available file extensions and copy related files in them.

- e.g: excel_file.xlsx and all other .xlsx files will be added in one folder called xlsx, and so forth.
- If the file, excel_file.xlsx for instance, is found in the folder already, the app will automatically change the new excel_file.xlsx name to excel_file(1).xlsx.
